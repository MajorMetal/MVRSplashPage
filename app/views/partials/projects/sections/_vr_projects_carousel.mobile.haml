          %p Gatball is a two player experience where you use your “gunsword”  to shoot and smack the soccer-like-ball into the other player’s net to score a goal. The player with the highest number of goals wins. Inside the Gatball battle grounds there’s a window streaming in the webcam of your PC, so you can watch your friends cheer you on.

          %img{src: asset_path('old-sparky-1.gif'), data: {toggle: 'modal', target: '#image-modal'}}

          %p This is a fully immersive VR experience where the player is literally shocked. Developed at the horror themed VR hackathon we hosted, we used shock pads, Arduinos, LED lights, a haptic vest, and an Oculus DK2 to create the experience. When the light on the back of the electric chair is on the person in the chair is ready to be shocked. The next person in line flips the switch and the player is shocked.
