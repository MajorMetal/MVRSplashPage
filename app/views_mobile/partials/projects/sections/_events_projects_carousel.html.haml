          %p Welcome to VR Film School; a 2 day work shop teaching VR enthusiasts how to become VR directors. The goal is to go from knowing nothing about VR to having a piece of 360 video content that is yours to share with the world. There will be different tracks of education for different workflows like "Shooting with GoPro Rigs" or "Shooting with the theta camera". We are bringing together major VR film directors, hardware providers and technical experts to help you get started right.
